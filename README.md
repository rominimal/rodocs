### Quality of uploads

When someone uploads [transcodes](transcodes-and-spectral-analysis/#transcodes), [stretched files \(traxdb\)](how-to-fill-in-upload-with-correct-meta-data/labeling-uploads.md#stretched), [irrelevant music](https://romnml.rv7.ru/?irrelevant=true) \(what's not related to minimal/deep\), uploader suppose to label these files himself to avoid be fined \(this is possible to do via [roboard](https://roboard.rv7.ru/)\).

[Here](./#penalty-scale) you can find the penalty scale. 

### Bad metadata of uploads

When someone uploads a track named "_Unknown Artist - Unknown Title_", or "_01. Track 01.wav_", or "666666\_Oops\_I\_Did\_It\_Again.wav", it must be [fixed](how-to-fill-in-upload-with-correct-meta-data/) **right away**. Otherwise member gets a penalty. Red card gives member 1 month of "vacation".

### Activity in big groups

### Inactivity measures

Members, who's uploads _made within last 30 days_ have 0 downloads are receive notification about upcoming measures. If situation does not change within following 30 days member gets fine every next 3 days. Penalty scale could be found [here](./#penalty-scale).

That means, if you do not upload something within a month you will get a notification. If you upload something and it won't be downloaded – you also get a notification.

If you have no time for active participating, just leave the group. Whenever you need to get back, you can enter again through the interview process, but not earlier than 30 days since you left.

## Download accounting

To be able to download – be sure you also shared something anybody could appreciate with a download.

**1 download** of your file gives you **1 chatle**.  
**1 download** by you today takes **0.93 chatles**.

If you uploaded a track that haven't been downloaded by anybody, you get 0 chatles for it.

Your current balance is available in the _Stats_ section of [@romnml\_bot](https://t.me/romnml_bot) or in [roboard](https://romnml.rv7.ru/).

In order to keep community members active, it is necessary to maintain a good balance of chatles. Members with less than **10 chatles** on balance within **30 days** are being expelled.

## Happy hours

Sometimes Happy Hours are happening. It means that all requested tracks worth you less than usual - just **0.5 chatles**.

Here's [iCal feed](webcal://p59-caldav.icloud.com/published/2/MTA1NzA4MzE5MDEwNTcwOByVOK82283DPQeKNpGhMsQIiuLqDnJJlYucWHqDNYR2SA9CDfXeiUPi2MjJFKpvNQ97x-ZsyCe18yafEawXG9o) for your calendar.

Also during Happy Hours, once approved, [bad metadata](https://romnml.rv7.ru/?badTagged=true) fix brings you **0.33 chatles** instead of 0.1.

## Alternative ways of getting chatles

You can propose [bad metadata](https://roboard.rv7.ru/?needsFix=true) fixes in order to earn some chatles.  
Please read [this manual](how-to-fill-in-upload-with-correct-meta-data/) before proposing any changes.  
One successfully approved change gives you **0.1 chatles** \(effectively 10 successful changes give you possibility to download one file\).

## Penalty scale

Members whose balance is over 100 chatles **got fined** for 10 chatles for a track.  
Members whose balance is under 100 chatles **got fined** for 1 chatle for a track.
