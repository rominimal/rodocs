### Bunches of tracks

It is only allowed up to a **10 tracks per bunch**!  
The only exception is complete releases with more tracks.

When user uploads more than 10 random tracks in a bunch, he receives a penalty!  
2 penalty gives a user 1 month of "vacation".

### Quality of uploads

When user uploads a [transcodes](https://bit.ly/2qyzphj), stretched files \(traxdb\), irrelevant music \(what's not related to minimal/deep\), he suppose to label these files himself to avoid be fined \(possible via [roboard](https://romnml.rv7.ru/)\).

[Here](./#penalty-scale) you can find the fining scale. 

### Bad metadata of uploads

When user uploads track named "_Unknown Artist - Unknown Title_", or "_01. Track 01.wav_", he's obliged to [fix its metadata](how-to-fill-in-upload-with-correct-meta-data/) **right away**. If not, he receives a penalty. 2 penalties gives a user 1 month of "vacation".

### Activity in big groups

Please note that members activity in big sharing groups is not welcome \(it's totally fine if happening in small groups though\). Activity means sharing or requesting music. When spotted a member gets "yellow" card. Second occasion gives user one month ban.

## Download accounting

To be able to download – be sure you also shared something anybody could appreciate with a download.

**1 download** of your file gives you **1 chatle**.  
**1 download** by you today takes **0.93 chatles**.

If you uploaded a track that haven't been downloaded by anybody, you get 0 chatles for it.

Your current balance is available in the _Stats_ section of [@romnml\_bot](https://t.me/romnml_bot) or in [roboard](https://romnml.rv7.ru/).

In order to keep community members active, it is necessary to maintain a good balance of chatles. Members having less than **10 chatles** within **30 days** are being excluded.

## Happy hours

Every Monday, between [20:00 and 22:00 CET](https://www.google.com/search?q=20%3A00+CET) Happy Hours are taking place. It means that all requested tracks worth you less than usual - just **0.5 chatles**.

Also one approved [bad metadata](https://romnml.rv7.ru/?badTagged=true) fix brings you **0.33 chatles** instead of 0.1.

## File formats

You can turn requested downloads to preferred audio format using [@convrt\_bot](https://t.me/convrt_bot)

## Alternative ways of getting chatles

You can propose [bad metadata](https://romnml.rv7.ru/?badTagged=true) fixes in order to earn some chatles.  
Please read [this manual](how-to-fill-in-upload-with-correct-meta-data/) before proposing any changes.  
One successfully approved change gives you **0.1 chatles** \(effectively 10 successfull changes give you 1 download at this point\).

## General rules

**Please, think twice \(or more\) before uploading anything. Do not upload just anything random. People who're uploading weird stuff \(badly tagged files, bad transcodes, not relevant to rominimal\) might be banned forever. We all love music here and treating it with respect.**

When one's uploaded music that is irrelevant to Romanian wave of minimal, a transcode, track from DJ mix or DJ mix itself, they might be fined. If you spotted that you accedentially uploaded one of the listed and labeled it in [roboard](https://romnml.rv7.ru/) yourself, you won't be fined.

### Penalty scale

Users whose balance is over **500 chatles** got fined for **50 chatles** for a track.  
Users whose balance is over **100 chatles** got fined for **10 chatles** for a track.  
Users whose balance is under **100 chatles** got fined for **1 chatle** for a track.
