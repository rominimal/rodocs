### Download accounting

To be able to download – be sure you also shared something anybody could appreciate with a download.

**1 download** of your file gives you **1 chatle**.  
**1 download** by you today takes **0.93 chatles**.

If you uploaded a track that haven't been downloaded by anybody, you get 0 chatles for it.

Your current balance is available in the _Stats_ section of [@romnml\_bot](https://t.me/romnml_bot) or in [roboard](https://romnml.rv7.ru/).

In order to keep community members active, it is necessary to maintain a good balance of chatles. Members having less than **10 chatles** within **30 days** are being excluded.

### Alternative ways of getting chatles

You can propose [bad metadata](https://romnml.rv7.ru/?badTagged=true) fixes in order to earn some chatles.  
Please read [this manual](http://bit.ly/how-to-fix-metadata) before proposing any changes.  
One successfully approved change gives you **0.1 chatles** \(effectively 10 successfull changes give you 1 download at this point\).

### General rules

**Please, think twice \(or more\) before uploading anything. Do not upload just anything random. People who're uploading weird stuff \(badly tagged files, bad transcodes, not relevant to rominimal\) might be banned forever. We all love music here and treating it with respect.**

When one's uploaded music that is irrelevant to Romanian wave of minimal, a transcode, track from DJ mix or DJ mix itself, they might be fined. If you spotted that you accedentially uploaded one of the listed and labeled it in [roboard](https://romnml.rv7.ru/) yourself, you won't be fined.

Users whose balance is over **500 chatles** got fined for **50 chatles** for a track.  
Users whose balance is over **100 chatles** got fined for **10 chatles** for a track.  
Users whose balance is under **100 chatles** got fined for **1 chatle** for a track.

We kindly requesting you to share music in 320 kbps MP3, or any lossless format \(WAV/FLAC/AIFF\), 44100 hz or above.

#### IMPORTANT

Uploading MP3 of what we have in lossless it is a **ban for 30 days** \(unless what we have in lossless is a rip, and you upload MP3 masters\). Second case – **ban forever**!

Let's try to keep it clean and strive to upload complete releases \(ideally, with the links to the info\). Or just bunches of tracks related to a certain artist.

### Happy hours
