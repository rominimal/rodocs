Not much you can do here, apart from start using [Telegarm Desktop](https://desktop.telegram.org/) or [Teleram Web](https://web.telegram.org/) for uploading files in the group.

### In roboard I see some tracks in red. What is that?

If you have something from these tracks, please upload them and help to restore the library!  
For successful track restoration you get **0.1** chatles.
