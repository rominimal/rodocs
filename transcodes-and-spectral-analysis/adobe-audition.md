# Adobe Audition

Adobe Audition is not free, so you must either use the trial version, pay for a license, or find a cracked copy to install. The trial and paid versions can be downloaded here: [https://www.adobe.com/products/audition.html](https://www.adobe.com/products/audition.html)

Installing the cracked version can be rather challenging if you are unused to installing cracked software with complicated installation/cracking procedures. Make sure you carefully follow the installation instructions included with the cracked software.

Once you've installed Audition, go ahead and launch it. The example screenshots and instructions below pertain to Audition CC 2015.0, but should generally be applicable/similar to other versions. As a matter of fact the OSX version looks very alike.

When Audition first loads, it should look something like this:

We want the spectrogram to take up as much space as possible, and most of the displayed items are irrelevant, so click on the **â‰¡** button next to the panel name on the tab on each unwanted panel and click on **Close Panel**. Remove all the panels with red highlights \(Files, Favorites, Media Browser, Effects Rack, Markers, History, Video, Mixer and Levels\). Do not close the Editor or Selection/View panels.

It should now look like this:

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2858%29.png)

Click on **View** and click on **Show Editor Panel Controls** to remove it.

Click on **Window** and click on **Tools** to remove it. Click Windows again and click on **Zoom** to add it.

It should now look like this:

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2846%29.png)

Now click and hold down the left mouse button on the tabs for the **Selection/View** and **Zoom** panels and drag them above the **Properties** panel:

It should now look like this:

Move the mouse over the panel borders and click/hold to drag them around to reposition them, like this:

Click on **Window** and click on **Frequency Analysis**.

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2831%29.png)

Click/hold the left mouse button and drag the Frequency Analysis panel onto the same row as the **Editor**, then release it:

Then close the Frequency Analysis panel:

Click on **Edit**, **Preferences** and **Spectral Displays**.

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2884%29.png)

Select the following settings:

* Windowing Function: Blackman-Harris
* Spectral Resolution: 1024
* Decibel Range: between 160 and 180
* Show gridlines: unchecked

Press **OK**. Drag/drop an audio file onto Audition. You'll probably see something like this:

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2873%29.png)

Click on **View** and click on **Show Spectral Frequency Display**. You can toggle between the spectrogram and waveform views with **Ctrl+D**.

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2832%29.png)

You should see something like this:

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%289%29.png)

Click on **View** and **Show HUD** to hide it.

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2864%29.png)

If the spectral view displays a second pair of waveforms above the spectrograms, below the thin waveforms on top, click on and drag the divider up until they're hidden.

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2868%29.png)

Right-click the frequency scale on the right side of the screen, and click on **Full Linear** if it is not greyed out \(if it is, just click outside the menu.\) Make sure that **Hertz** is selected rather than **Notes**.

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2826%29.png)

Right-click the time scale above the spectrogram, and click on **Time Display** and on **Decimal \(mm:ss.ddd\)**

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2857%29.png)

You should be done setting up Audition. Go ahead and close the file without saving it.
